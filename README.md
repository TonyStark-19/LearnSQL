## 🧠 About the Project

I created this project while learning SQL through the [Apna College SQL One Shot Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlGoQC332VM&t=11487s). The website presents SQL theory in a clear and structured manner, including topics like:

- SQL Commands (DDL, DML, DQL, DCL, TCL)
- SQL Data Types
- Joins
- Aggregate Functions
- Subqueries
- Projects and more!

The content is curated from Apna College’s material and enhanced with my own understanding and design techniques.
